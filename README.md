## Description

SOPHIA is a speech operated personal household interactive assistant. This app is built for two audiences: Clients and Caretakers. Clients are anyone with a disability (physical, cognitive, long-term, temporary) who needs care. Caretakers include anyone who is willing to help take care of clients. Taking care could include running errands, cleaning, yardwork, paying bills, grocery shopping, etc. SOPHIA was built to connect clients to caretakers to help meet their daily needs.

Please reference the user stories to understand the full functionality of SOPHIA.

SOPHIA is an A11Y app with a large focus on accessibility.

## Technologies Used
  - [Ruby On Rails](https://guides.rubyonrails.org/)
  - [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/)

## Learning Goals

This is a unique opportunity that presents some valuable goals:

* Ultimately, demonstrate knowledge youâ€™ve gained throughout Turing
* Use an agile process to turn well defined requirements into deployed and production ready software
* Gain experience dividing applications into components and domains of responsibilities to facilitate multi-developer teams.
* Service oriented architecture concepts and patterns are highly encouraged.
* Explore and implement new concepts, patterns, or libraries that have not been explicitly taught while at Turing
* Practice an advanced, professional git workflow (see whole-team expectations)
* Gain more experience using continuous integration tools to build and automate the deployment of features in various environments
* Build applications that execute in development, test, CI, and production environments
* Focus on communication between front-end and back-end teams in order to complete and deploy features that have been outlined by the project spec
